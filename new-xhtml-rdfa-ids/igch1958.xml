        Reggio coins)

    A letter from Vlasto in the ANS confirms 
        that his Cat. 18, although ascribed to 
        Noe 689, is from this hd.
    Notes in the ANS state that Lockett 
        purchased from this hd. 3 coins as his
        404-6
    In addition to the bulk of the hd. preserved 
        at Reggio, it seems likely that c. 40 AV 
        of Metapontum (most with Leucippus 
        hd.) were dispersed. A note in the 
        ANS states that all the hd. coins as 
        SNGLockett 406 were more worn than 
        the other Metapontum AV. This note 
        further describes 120-125 AR seen in 
        commerce which purportedly were 
        from this hd.: c. 100 Taras, 7 Meta-
        pontum, 5 Croton, 1 Locri, and 2 
        Thurian dist. The Locri coin is de-
        scribed as ϕ type (probably a Pega-
        sus); the others were similar to those 
        at Reggio
    ANSSNG 1, 1215, published as from this 
        hd., is of Per. VIII and probably from 
        no. 1997 below

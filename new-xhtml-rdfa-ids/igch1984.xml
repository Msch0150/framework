    Disposition: The evidence is confused. The 
        Vlasto Cat. records nos. 711-2, 721, 
        744, 854, 916-8 as from Lot B (N.
        1057); of these, however, only one 
        variety (no. 744) appears in Borelli's 
        list. On the other hand all these va-
        rieties, except no. 854, are represented 
        in Vlasto's list of Lot A; nos. 916-8, 
        all fdc are particularly significant, 
        because Lot A included 8 fdc examples 
        of this variety. Turning to Lot A, the 
        Vlasto Cat. records only no. 796 as 
        from this source; this is surprising 
        because Vlasto's gift of 1 Thurium and
        2 Croton to the BM (editorial note to 
        Vlasto NC 1922) strongly suggests that 
        Vlasto himself had acquired the whole 
        of Lot A, and given away the non-
        Tarentine coins which did not interest 
        him. A further complication is that 
        Vlasto Cat. attributes nos. 919-23 (die 
        varieties of 916-8) to N. 1058; this is 
        impossible for N. 1058 (Molossian find) 
        included nothing later than Per. IV. 
        There can be little doubt that Cat. 
        916-8 (attributed to N. 1057) and 
        919-23 (attributed to N. 1058) are to-
        gether the 8 examples of Per. VIII, L3 
        listed in N. 1056. Finally Cat. 854 
        (Per. VIII, B1), a variety which is to 
        be found in neither Lot A or B, could 
        derive from either no. 2000 or no. 1998 
        below. The most probable conclusion 
        is that Lots A and B constitute a single 
        hd. found in 1922, and that Lot A 
        represents a selection acquired by 
        Vlasto before Borelli listed the re-
        mainder. Disposition can be recon-
        structed as follows: London ex Vlasto
        3 (1 Thurium, 2 Croton); Vlasto 12 
        (Cat. 711-2, 721, 744, 916-23).

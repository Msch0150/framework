296 Greece?, date unknown
    Burial: after 120 B.C. (T); after 87 (Lewis) 
    Contents: 48+ AR. Probably part of a hoard 
    <span rel="mint" resource="athens">Athens:</span> New Style tetradr.
    Disposition: Toronto
    Thompson, Athens (Ontario hd.), pp. 501-2, illus. 
    Lewis, NC 1962, p. 281
    Further information on this hd. or hds. has 
        been received from John Wilkinson of 
        Toronto. Apparently the coins were 
        purchased from Baldwin's in two 
        lots-one in 1928 and the other in 
        1930. We may be dealing with parts of 
        two hds. and a connection of the 1930
        lot with Halmyros (no. 289 above) is 
        a possibility

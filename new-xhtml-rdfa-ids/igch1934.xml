    Disposition: Vlasto acquired the whole hd., 
        but retained only 2 Taras (Cat. 250, 
        319); remainder sold to Spink, who 
        resold to Egger. The distribution 
        appears to be: Taras, Egger Nov. 
        12 ff., 1913, 68; Heracleia, Lloyd (SNG 
        273) and Spink, Num. Circ. 1913, 
        nos. 1161-2; Metapontum, Num. Circ.,
        nos. 1256, 1262, 1265, 1270, 1274 and
        Egger Nov. 12 ff., 1913, 170 (= Spink 
        1256); Thurium, Num. Circ. 3645, 
        3648; Croton, Num. Circ., 4686
    Vlasto, NNM 15 (1922), pp. 206-7 
    Stazio, AIIN 1965-7, p. 56
    Vlasto, Cat. 612 is also said to be from this 
        hd., but no such coin appears in 
        NNM 15, unless it be "I uncertain 
        horseman." Spink, Num. Circ. no. 3655 
        is also given this hd. as provenance, 
        but the variety (BMC 14) is not listed 
        in NNM 15, and its inclusion would 
        raise the hd. total above the 19 stated 
        by Vlasto. As to Metapontum, Vlasto 
        wrote to Noe (Sept. 12, 1920) that 
        these were "mostly of the type figured 
        in Egger XLV, nos. 153-7, 160 and 
        170, which is the specimen from this 
        small find;" from this it appears that 
        only 170 is actually from the find, and 
        not the others as well, as assumed by 
        Noe

 <div property="skos:definition" xml:lang="en">The study of the coins, other numismatic items and numismatic history of the Ancient Greek World. At its broadest, this encompasses the numismatic productions of the Mediterranean world prior to the rise of Roman power, including such areas as Gaul, Britain, and Spain. It is appropriate to include the coinages of Greek cities under the empire in the study of Greek numismatics, though more recent scholarship emphasizes the imperial context of this material.</div>

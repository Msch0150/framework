    Disposition: Taranto, the majority; Evans 
        300, from which Jameson 7 (Cat. 
        217-223) and Vlasto 9 (Cat. 771, 938, 
        940-2, 947, 961 ?, 963, 969). It is likely 
        that most of the examples of Per. VII-
        IX in SNGOxford recorded as bought 
        by Oxford from Evans in 1885 were 
        from this hd., as well as SNG 999-1003 
        and 1008 (all Thurium, ex Evans)
    Evans, NC 1889, pp. 165-9, 219-28
    The Jameson Cat. records nos. 217-23 as 
        ex Evans, "Trouvaille de Tarente 
        1887." Noe took this to refer to his 
        no. 505 (= no. 1917 above); this, 
        however, is an early 4th cent. hd. 
        Since the coins are all of Per. IX and 
        were acquired from Evans, 1887 is
        certainly a mistake for 1883. Vlasto 
        Cat. no. 961 is mistakenly attributed 
        to N. 1058, the 4th cent. "Molossian 
        find;" for a similar confusion con-
        cerning N. 1058, see no. 1984 above

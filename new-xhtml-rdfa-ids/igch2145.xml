    Disposition: Syracuse 145 as above
    Cesano, StudNum. (1940), p. 63
    Jenkins, ANSCent., p. 376
    Currò Pisanò, AIIN 1962-4, pp. 224, 237
    Cesano states that the Syracuse lot repre-
        sents about half the total hd., but 
        Currò Pisanò (p. 237) gives the original 
        total as 176 (that of Noe 977)
    Jenkins equates the Cesarò 1916 hd. of 
        Cesano with Noe's 167 (Bronte 1915);
        lie does not, however, take the further 
        step of equating these two with Noe 
        977 (Sicily 1916). The hd. may origi-
        nally have contained, in addition to 
        the above, a tetradr. of Messana (Noe 
        167), 1 decadr. and 14 tetradr. of 
        Syracuse, and 1 tetradr. of Leontini 
        (Noe 977)
    The two Pegasi of Argos (shield) and 
        Thyrrheium (ear-ring) included in this 
        hd. at Syracuse must be intrusive; 
        though both are later issues than any 
        other pegasi in the hd., both are far 
        more worn than the other pegasi

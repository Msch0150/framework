    Disposition: New York and C. Hersh a few 
    A record of the 89 coins detailed above is in the 
    ANS
    The coin from Ace is dated yr. 22 (= 
        324 B.C.). The other coins are all struck 
        before 321 with the exception of one
        coin from Abydus (= BMC 506) which 
        is currently dated c. 307. The absence 
        of drachms of Philip III is in favor of 
        an early date and indicates that the 
        single late coin is intrusive

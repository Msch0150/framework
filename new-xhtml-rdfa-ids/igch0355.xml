* The 2 octadr. cited in the BlM as part of 
        the Kaliandra 1913 hd., no. 358 below, 
        otherwise containing only Mende 
        tetradr., almost certainly belong to the 
        find from Ishtib and were probably 
        confused with coins from the Kaliandra 
        hd. by Ritsos who acquired a major 
        portion of both finds

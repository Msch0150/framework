    Currò Pisanò, AIIN 1962-4, p. 228
    A number of obviously intrusive coins, as 
        AE of Carthage and Claudius Gothicus, 
        are assembled under this heading. Of 
        the Pegasi, two (Thyrrheium and 
        Corinth, Per. V) are obviously in-
        trusive, but the remaining four form a 
        group which might terminate soon 
        after 400 B.C. (Ambracia, Ravel P. 27, 
        and Leucas, BMCCorinth, pl. 34, 7). 
        They are also united by a brownish 
        oxidized surface which is shared by 
        some of the other coins listed (5 dr. of 
        Rhegium, 1 didr. each of Acragas and 
        Gela, both AR coins of Syracuse)
    Under the heading "Milazzo 1947" the BM 
        has a record of a find (presumably the 
        same time as that above) of 70+ AR 
        including:
    Acragas: 2 tetradr. (as Rizzo, MGS, pl. 2, 
        1 and 10)
    <span rel="mint" resource="camarina">Camarina:</span> tetradr.
            2 didr. (as R., pl. 7, 8 and one 
        with facing hd.)
    Catana: 1 tetradr. (as R., pl. 14, 10) 
            1 dr. signed by Euainetos
    Gela: 2 tetradr. (as R., pl. 18, 7 and 14 = 
        Jenkins Grps. VII and IX)
    Messana: tetradr. fdc, with symbols: Pan 
        hd., dolphin, barley-ear, bird and 
        barley-ear
    Naxus: tetradr. with young Dionysus hd. 
    Syracuse: tetradr. (incl. Tudeer nos. 42, 
        58, 78-81)
            dr. (as Rizzo, pl. 47, 9 and facing 
        Athena/Leucaspis)
    This group cannot have been buried much 
        before 400 B.C.

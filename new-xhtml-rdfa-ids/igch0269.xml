    There is some confusion about this hd. 
        Oeconomides reports 131 coins in 
        Athens (gift of Kyriaki) and connects 
        them with the Hephaisteion find of 
        150 AE cited by Varoucha (BCH 1950, 
        p. 292) of which 40 pieces went to 
        Athens according to the BCH account. 
        Price publishes the hd. as found at 
        Kyriaki in eastern Attica. Thompson 
        in the 1960's recorded a hoard of 41 AE 
        (no. 268 above) in the Athens Cabinet 
        which would seem to be the deposit of 
        BCH 1950. It is possible, of course, 
        that Kyriaki and no. 268 represent 
        two sections of the same hd.; the 
        contents are similar
